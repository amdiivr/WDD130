                <h2>Logitech MX Keys Unboxing<h2>
                <p>The presentation of the Logitech MX Keys arrives in a dark gray matte cardboard box. On its cover we see the usual image of the product accompanied by the company logo and model. This wireless illuminated keyboard stands out with its ultra-slim design and scissor switches, prominent on the right for fluid typing.
                Turning to the other side, this is where they really explain the most interesting aspects of Logitech MX Keys apart from its compatibility with all current operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android).
                Watch the video to get more information on how we were using it.</p>

                <h2>Konami returns with its horror franchise for Silent Hill fans.</h2>
                <p>Let's start with the first one, a complete Remake of Silent Hill 2 made by Bloober Team and exclusive for PS5 and PC returns the story and horror game known by many released in 2001. After 10 years Konami was encouraged to make the Remake and it was announced that the story is also adapted to a new movie that we will talk about later, in addition to this remake that the trailer really looks fantastic, we still do not know if it will really be as well since the gameplay is something else, they mentioned that the game would take advantage of dual sense control and 3D audio, plus what we see was done with the Unreal Engine 5 graphics engine. Konami has also revealed 3 games from the same SILENT hILL universe, named Silent Hill Townfall, Ascension and F. Silent Hill Townfall made by Annapurna interactive and No code, shows a small teaser trailer of how the game would be. Ascension looks more like an interactive chat in the teaser, different from the usual one which comes from studio Abrams, bad Robot and Genvid, this one does mention that it would be out in 2023. Silent Hill F story by RyÅ«kishi07 the truth is that I don't even know how to say it but according to sources this creator is known for creating acclaimed visual novels with psychological horror and supernatural mysteries as we see in the teaser and developed by NEOBARDS.</p>

                <h2>The New Lightspeed Wireless RGB Logitech for gaming.</h2>
                <p>The Logitech G915 TKL is a full-size mechanical keyboard of the TKL type, that is, with the number part removed. Its width is less than 37 mm, and all this without giving up enough function keys or fabulous performance and comfort of use.
                The materials and manufacturing details are appreciated as soon as you put your fingers on it. The body is made of high-quality and robust plastic, but it is also finished off with an aluminum alloy top plate that gives it a lot of presence and a steel-reinforced base.
                With all this we achieve a very interesting balance between lightness (810 grams without cable) and thickness (22 mm) without giving up enormous robustness and stability on the table. And a lot of comfort of use due to its low profile. 
                The result is excellent in practically all its facets. Finish, quality of the switches, reliability of the connectivity, autonomy and benefits are at the top of the peripheral market of this cut. So, if you make the investment, you will not be disappointed.</p>
