                <h2>Corsair's new Voyager a1600 would be the company's first laptop with a Touchbar.</h2>
                <p>The new laptop is powered by Ryzen 6000 series and AMD Radeon RX 6000 series processors, making it Corsair's first laptop made for gaming. What characterizes much more about the new laptop is the way that the TouchBar can be used, this new implementation for them they call direct access for the "S" key, although the name is not short, it refers to the utility that you can have with the touch bar, according to Corsair it is not a bar where other keys are replaced but it is personalized because its usefulness would be compared to the Elgato's stream deck, implying that it would help a lot in the streaming service. Physically the device was shown during AMD's Computex keynote and according to the renders they show us what the final product would look like. According to the technical specifications you could choose between the following: Ryzen 7 6800HS Ryzen 9 6900HS Both configurations come with a Radeon 6800M GPU. You can get up to 64GB of RAM (Corsair Vengeance DDR5) and 2TB of storage. It would have a 16-inch 2560 x 1600, 240 Hz screen and two Thunderbolt 3 USB 4.0 ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type C, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type A, an SDXC 7.0 card reader and an audio jack, FHD 1080p camera and full-size Cherry MX low-profile mechanical keyboard with RGB backlighting.</p>

                <h2>Tesla owners will soon be able to access digitally distributed games inside their cars.</h2>
                <p>Although decent free games are already present in the car since 2019, such as “Solitaire and chess”, oldies arcade “Missile command and Super Breakcout” and other classics, now Tesla is committed to integrating the Steam digital gaming platform for next month according to Elon Musk's response to a video on Twitter.
                The arrival of Steam has great potential to take the gaming experience inside the car to another level, because we would have more than 50,000 games, playing from Counter-Strike to Elder Ring.
                Currently the Model S and Model X runs on an AMD Ryzen CPU and AMD RDNA-2 GPU until it can run the game Cyberpunk 2077 according to a Twitter reference by Elon Musk as well.
                What is not allowed is to play it during autopilot because this led to an investigation in 2021 by the NHTSA in the United States.</p>
