        Konami returns with its horror franchise for Silent Hill fans.

        Let's start with the first one, a complete Remake of Silent Hill 2 made by Bloober Team and exclusive for PS5 and PC returns the story and horror game known by many released in 2001.
        
        After 10 years Konami was encouraged to make the Remake and it was announced that the story is also adapted to a new movie that we will talk about later, in addition to this remake that the trailer really looks fantastic, we still do not know if it will really be as well since the gameplay is something else, they mentioned that the game would take advantage of dual sense control and 3D audio, plus what we see was done with the Unreal Engine 5 graphics engine.
        Konami has also revealed 3 games from the same SILENT hILL universe, named Silent Hill Townfall, Ascension and F.
        Silent Hill Townfall made by Annapurna interactive and No code, shows a small teaser trailer of how the game would be.
        Ascension looks more like an interactive chat in the teaser, different from the usual one which comes from studio Abrams, bad Robot and Genvid, this one does mention that it would be out in 2023.
        Silent Hill F story by RyÅ«kishi07 the truth is that I don't even know how to say it but according to sources this creator is known for creating acclaimed visual novels with psychological horror and supernatural mysteries as we see in the teaser and developed by NEOBARDS.
