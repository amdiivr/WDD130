        Corsair's new Voyager a1600 would be the company's first laptop with a Touchbar.
        
        The new laptop is powered by Ryzen 6000 series and AMD Radeon RX 6000 series processors, making it Corsair's first laptop made for gaming.
        What characterizes much more about the new laptop is the way that the TouchBar can be used, this new implementation for them they call direct access for the "S" key, although the name is not short, it refers to the utility that you can have with the touch bar, according to Corsair it is not a bar where other keys are replaced but it is personalized because its usefulness would be compared to the Elgato's stream deck, implying that it would help a lot in the streaming service.
        Physically the device was shown during AMD's Computex keynote and according to the renders they show us what the final product would look like.
        According to the technical specifications you could choose between the following:
        Ryzen 7 6800HS
        Ryzen 9 6900HS
        Both configurations come with a Radeon 6800M GPU. You can get up to 64GB of RAM (Corsair Vengeance DDR5) and 2TB of storage.
        It would have a 16-inch 2560 x 1600, 240 Hz screen and two Thunderbolt 3 USB 4.0 ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type C, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type A, an SDXC 7.0 card reader and an audio jack, FHD 1080p camera and full-size Cherry MX low-profile mechanical keyboard with RGB backlighting.

        Tesla owners will soon be able to access digitally distributed games inside their cars.

        Although decent free games are already present in the car since 2019, such as “Solitaire and chess”, oldies arcade “Missile command and Super Breakcout” and other classics, now Tesla is committed to integrating the Steam digital gaming platform for next month according to Elon Musk's response to a video on Twitter. The arrival of Steam has great potential to take the gaming experience inside the car to another level, because we would have more than 50,000 games, playing from Counter-Strike to Elder Ring. Currently the Model S and Model X runs on an AMD Ryzen CPU and AMD RDNA-2 GPU until it can run the game Cyberpunk 2077 according to a Twitter reference by Elon Musk as well. What is not allowed is to play it during autopilot because this led to an investigation in 2021 by the NHTSA in the United States.

        Logitech MX Keys Unboxing

        The presentation of the Logitech MX Keys arrives in a dark gray matte cardboard box. On its cover we see the usual image of the product accompanied by the company logo and model. This wireless illuminated keyboard stands out with its ultra-slim design and scissor switches, prominent on the right for fluid typing. Turning to the other side, this is where they really explain the most interesting aspects of Logitech MX Keys apart from its compatibility with all current operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android). Watch the video to get more information on how we were using it.

        Konami returns with its horror franchise for Silent Hill fans.

        Let's start with the first one, a complete Remake of Silent Hill 2 made by Bloober Team and exclusive for PS5 and PC returns the story and horror game known by many released in 2001.
        
        After 10 years Konami was encouraged to make the Remake and it was announced that the story is also adapted to a new movie that we will talk about later, in addition to this remake that the trailer really looks fantastic, we still do not know if it will really be as well since the gameplay is something else, they mentioned that the game would take advantage of dual sense control and 3D audio, plus what we see was done with the Unreal Engine 5 graphics engine.
        Konami has also revealed 3 games from the same SILENT hILL universe, named Silent Hill Townfall, Ascension and F.
        Silent Hill Townfall made by Annapurna interactive and No code, shows a small teaser trailer of how the game would be.
        Ascension looks more like an interactive chat in the teaser, different from the usual one which comes from studio Abrams, bad Robot and Genvid, this one does mention that it would be out in 2023.
        Silent Hill F story by Ryūkishi07 the truth is that I don't even know how to say it but according to sources this creator is known for creating acclaimed visual novels with psychological horror and supernatural mysteries as we see in the teaser and developed by NEOBARDS.

        The New Lightspeed Wireless RGB Logitech for gaming.

        The Logitech G915 TKL is a full-size mechanical keyboard of the TKL type, that is, with the number part removed. Its width is less than 37 mm, and all this without giving up enough function keys or fabulous performance and comfort of use. The materials and manufacturing details are appreciated as soon as you put your fingers on it. The body is made of high-quality and robust plastic, but it is also finished off with an aluminum alloy top plate that gives it a lot of presence and a steel-reinforced base. With all this we achieve a very interesting balance between lightness (810 grams without cable) and thickness (22 mm) without giving up enormous robustness and stability on the table. And a lot of comfort of use due to its low profile. The result is excellent in practically all its facets. Finish, quality of the switches, reliability of the connectivity, autonomy and benefits are at the top of the peripheral market of this cut. So, if you make the investment, you will not be disappointed.
